# chilly.tech marketing page

## Getting going

Our marketing site is built and deployed with [Jekyll](//jekyllrb.com). 

1. `gem install jekyll bundler` to get started.
2. Run `jekyll serve` and a watcher will automagically watch for file changes. Check `localhost:3000` (default) for changes.
3. Compiled sass and html is delivered to `_site/`. If we're deploying using anything other than ghpages, upload that folder.

That's it! Have fun, follow style guidelines. ✌️
